ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hp35.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in algorithms and compact implementations in C and CWEB (the latter being
my favourite markup language). A special interest is stack programming and PostScript, which
I occasionally do just for fun in my spare time. Historically, I have implemented simulators
and stuff in Fortran 77, which I to some extent still enjoy.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Verilog and implementation in the Xilinx Zynq 7020 FPGA.
