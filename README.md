ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hp35.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in algorithms and compact implementations in C and [CWEB](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html) (the latter being
my favourite markup language). A special interest is stack programming and [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript), which
I occasionally do just for fun in my spare time. Historically, I have implemented simulators
and stuff in Fortran 77, which I to some extent still enjoy.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Verilog and implementation in the [Xilinx Zynq 7020](https://redpitaya.com/sdrlab-122-16/) FPGA.
